# Schengen Zone Planner

This is very much WIP. Let me know if you're interested in seeing this deployed and updated!

The app uses data exported from [App in the Air](https://www.appintheair.mobi/) application to visualize days spent in Schengen zone.

Click on a date to see the number of days allowed to stay starting from that date given previous trips.
